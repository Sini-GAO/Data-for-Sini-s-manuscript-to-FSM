# FSM

This is the document in Sini's manuscript submitted to FSM. There are four branches in this project: main, DOE, Programming-for-large-numerical-example and Programming-for-small-numerical-example. 

It has: 
       (1) Approximate Pareto-optimal solutions files for the large numerical experiment (in Branch 'Programming-for-large-numerical-example');
       (2) DOE files for the small numerical example (in Branch 'DOE').
       
Exhausive seach code for the small numerical example, NSGA-II and AMOSA code for the small and large numerical examples will be shared after the manuscript is accepted.
