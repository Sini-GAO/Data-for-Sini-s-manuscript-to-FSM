# FSM

This is the programming document for the large numerical experiment in Sini's manuscript submitted to FSM.

It has: 
       (1) AMOSA code for the large numerical example (shared after the manuscript is accepted);
       (2) 10 files presenting the approximate Pareto-optimal solutions obtained by AMOSA for the large numerical example;
       (3) NSGA-II code for the large numerical example (shared after the manuscript is accepted);
       (4) 10 files presenting the approximate Pareto-optimal solutions obtained by AMOSA for the large numerical example;
       (5) Support file to obtain the analysis data in Table 5.
